🚀 Hackathon Battle Plan: Meteor Madness (Impactor-2025)
1️⃣ Define the Scope (Don’t Overbuild)

The challenge sounds huge (orbital mechanics, geology, tsunamis, mitigation strategies). In a hackathon, you should aim for a Minimum Viable Demo (MVD):

Input: Asteroid parameters (size, velocity, trajectory).

Processing: Estimate impact energy + basic consequences.

Output: A simple, beautiful, interactive visualization (map + orbital animation).

Extras (if time): Add mitigation slider (e.g., deflect asteroid by X m/s → new path).

2️⃣ Branding & Theme

Keep it visually cohesive:

Name idea: “Asteroid Impact Simulator (AIS)” or more fun like “Deflect 2025.”

Colour Palette (space + meteor theme):

Deep Space Navy #0B132B

Meteor Orange #FF6B35

Plasma Blue #3A86FF

Neutral Grey #E5E5E5

Fonts: Orbitron (headers) + Inter/Roboto (body).

UI vibe: NASA-inspired, clean, black-background dashboards with glowing accents.

3️⃣ Technical Stack (Fast & Lightweight)

Frontend: React + Tailwind (fast styling, responsive).

3D/2D Viz: Three.js (orbital paths), D3.js or Leaflet (impact maps).

Backend (optional, only if needed): Flask/FastAPI in Python for heavy calcs.

Data Sources:

NASA NEO API → asteroid size, velocity, orbit.

USGS topo/elevation datasets → tsunami risk or terrain visualization (can mock if time is short).

4️⃣ Core Features (Hackathon-Friendly)
Must-Haves ✅

Input asteroid size, velocity, trajectory (via sliders or default “Impactor-2025” dataset).

Simulate kinetic energy → estimate crater size, seismic magnitude.

Visualize:

3D orbit around Earth → asteroid path

2D map → potential impact site + risk zone

Nice-to-Haves ⭐

Deflection strategies (user adjusts velocity → orbit shifts).

Tsunami overlay (if impact in ocean).

Pop-up tooltips explaining physics terms in plain English.

Stretch Goals 🚀

Gamified “Defend Earth” mode → user must choose mitigation within time.

Social shareable impact maps.

Mobile version.

 (scaling law).

Tsunami Trigger: If impact zone = ocean → show expanding concentric rings overlay on map.

Mitigation (deflection): Simple velocity change (

Δv) shifts orbit → show new trajectory line.

These don’t need to be perfect, just consistent. Judges like plausible science, not full PhD accuracy.

6️⃣ User Flow

Landing: “Meet Impactor-2025” (intro screen with asteroid facts).

Input Panel: Size, velocity, impact location, or deflection strategy.

Simulation: Animated orbit → collision with Earth.

Results Dashboard: Impact energy (TNT equivalent), crater size, seismic magnitude, tsunami risk.

Mitigation Mode: User tries deflection → new orbit vs. Earth.

7️⃣ Pitch / Storytelling

Hook: “In 2025, Impactor-2025 could hit Earth. What happens next?”

Problem: Data exists, but it’s siloed and inaccessible to the public/policymakers.

Solution: A visual, interactive, scientifically-grounded simulator that makes impact risks understandable and lets users test mitigation strategies.

Demo: Show simulation (default asteroid, then adjust variables).

Impact: Bridges science ↔ public ↔ decision makers.

Vision: Scalable to all near-Earth asteroids, real-time NASA/USGS integration.

8️⃣ Hackathon Time Management

Hour 1–2: Team alignment → roles (frontend, backend, design, pitch).

Hour 3–5: Build UI skeleton + mock data.

Hour 6–12: Integrate NASA NEO API, set up orbital + impact visualizations.

Hour 13–18: Add deflection logic + polishing.

Hour 19–22: UX polish, branding, storytelling, make demo smooth.

Hour 23–24: Pitch deck + practice.
