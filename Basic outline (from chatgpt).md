## 🔭 1. Clarify the Problem

- **Restate the challenge** in your own words (one liner).
    
- Write down: _“We want to help ___ by solving ___ using ___.”_
    
- Define **core outputs**: is it a website, dashboard, app, data viz, simulation, or concept demo?

## 🎨 2. Branding & Visual Identity

Keep it simple, consistent, and thematic. For “Meteor Madness”:

- **Colours**:
    
    - ~~Primary: Deep Space Navy (`#0B132B`)
        
    - ~~Accent 1: Meteor Orange (`#FF6B35`)
        
    - ~~Accent 2: Plasma Blue (`#3A86FF`)
        
    - ~~Neutral: Light Grey (`#F5F5F5`) for backgrounds
        
- **Fonts**:
    
    - Header: ~~Orbitron or Montserrat (futuristic/clean)
        
    - Body: ~~Inter or Roboto (legible)
        
- **Mood**: Futuristic, urgent, but approachable.

## 🖥 3. Design Process

- **User Flow**: Sketch the _main journey_ (e.g., user logs in → sees meteor risk map → explores data → gets recommendations).
    
- **Wireframe** (quick Figma/pen sketch): Focus on function first, pretty later.
    
- **UI Elements**: Cards, map visualisations, progress bars, warning indicators.

## 💻 4. Coding & Tech

Depends on your team’s strengths:

- **Frontend (fast prototyping)**: React + Tailwind (easy styling, responsive)
    
- **Backend (if needed)**: Flask/FastAPI for quick APIs
    
- **Data**: NASA APIs (e.g., Near Earth Object API), Open Meteo, or CSV datasets
    
- **Visualisations**: Recharts, D3.js, or Plotly for graphs; Leaflet/Mapbox for maps
    
- **AI/ML (optional)**: Simple regression/classification for meteor impact prediction, or clustering past meteor events.

## 📊 5. Problem Analysis (Meteor Madness Angle)

Think about impact + audience:

- **Who cares?** (General public, scientists, schools, policymakers?)
    
- **What’s the gap?** (Awareness, education, prediction, visualization, emergency response)
    
- **What’s your edge?**
    
    - Eg: “We make meteor risk understandable to non-scientists with real-time visualisation.”
        
    - Or: “We predict near-Earth meteors & simulate impact zones for disaster planning.”

## ⏱ 6. Time Management (24-48h hackathon rhythm)

- **Hour 1-3**: Align on problem, audience, and decide final idea.
    
- **Hour 4-6**: Build skeleton (basic UI, API connections, mock data).
    
- **Hour 7-18**: Coding sprint (split tasks: frontend, backend, data).
    
- **Hour 19-22**: Polish UI, add branding, make demo presentable.
    
- **Hour 23-24**: Final pitch deck + dry run.

## 📢 7. Presentation & Pitch

Judges care about clarity, not just code.

- **Hook**: “Meteors are rare but deadly. What if everyone could understand the risk in real time?”
    
- **Demo**: Live walkthrough of your app (2–3 minutes).
    
- **Impact**: Why this matters (education, awareness, disaster readiness).
    
- **Future Vision**: How it could scale or integrate with NASA/open data.
